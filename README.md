# Travel Easy

Travel Easy aims to simplify weather and flight comparisons for multiple cities. View forecasts and historical weather data, and log in or sign up to save a home city and as many destinations as desired.

## Why?

While prospecting multiple cities for a winter getaway, I found myself collecting an overwhelming number of tabs to compare current and historical weather, and flight cost info (flight feature in progress).

Many sites and apps offer the ability to view weekly or 10-day forecasts for multiple cities, but none offered the ability to also compare historical averages over a period (what you might really want if looking for a vacation).

While I first tackled this challenge with a good ol' spreadsheet, it was laborious, and highly inconvenient.

Alas, Travel Easy to the rescue!
