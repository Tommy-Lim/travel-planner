# Travel Easy

Travel Easy aims to simplify weather and flight comparisons for multiple cities. View forecasts and historical weather data, and log in or sign up to save a home city and as many destinations as desired.

## Why?

While prospecting multiple cities for a winter getaway, I found myself collecting an overwhelming number of tabs to compare current and historical weather, and flight cost info.

Many sites and apps offer the ability to view weekly or 10-day forecasts for multiple cities, but none offered the ability to also compare historical averages over a period (what you might really want if looking for a vacation).

While I first tackled this challenge with a good ol' spreadsheet, it was laborious, and highly inconvenient.

Alas, Travel Easy to the rescue!
